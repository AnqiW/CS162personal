*the value of argv is (char **) 0x7fffffffe638, an array of arguments that are passed into the program 
* argv[0] points to the first argument, which is wc, "/home/vagrant/code/personal/hw0/wc" 0x7fffffffe852
* The address of the function main is at main= 0x40060d with x/40x main
* Info stack gives us all the frames in the call stack, in this case we can in the main function frame with two arguments the first one is the number of arguments gotten in the command line and the second argument is the array of arguments gotten
* Info frame gives us where the frame starts, frame number in backtrace, frames grow downwards on the stack. eip is the register that holding the address of the next instruction to be executed(is this same to the program counter?) Saved eip is the return address. It also shows the address of the caller stack frame. It tells us the address of the arguments and local variables. Saved registers are the two saved registers on the callee stack
* rax is holding the address of the main function, which is the return address.
